## PSQL Install instructions

### Mac

- Install Postrgres App https://postgresapp.com/
  - Open the app (little blue elephant) and select initialize/start
- type `psql` into your terminal. You should then see something similar to:

```psql
psql (9.6.5, server 9.6.6)
Type "help" for help.

username=#
```

- if the above does not show/you get an error, run the following commands in your terminal:
  - `brew update`
  - `brew doctor`
  - `brew install postgresql`

### Ubuntu

- Run this command in your terminal:

  `sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib`

- Next run the following commands to create a database user for Postgres.

  `sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER`

  `sudo -u postgres createdb $USER`

- Then run this command to enter the terminal application for PostgreSQL:

  `psql`

- Now type:

  `ALTER USER username WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretword123';`

  **BUT** Instead of `username` type your Ubuntu username and instead of `'mysecretword123'` choose your own password and be sure to wrap it in quotation marks. Use a simple password like 'password'. **DONT USE YOUR LOGIN PASSWORD** !

- You can then exit out of psql by typing `\q`
